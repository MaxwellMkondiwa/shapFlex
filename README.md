# package::shapFlex <img src="./tools/shapFlex_logo.png" alt="shapFlex logo" align="right" height="138.5" style="display: inline-block;">

The purpose of `shapFlex`, short for Shapley flexibility, is to compute stochastic feature-level Shapley values which 
can be used to (a) interpret and/or (b) assess the fairness of any machine learning model while 
**incorporating causal constraints into the model's feature space**. **[Shapley values](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html)** 
are an intuitive and theoretically sound model-agnostic diagnostic tool to understand both **global feature importance** across all instances in a data set 
and instance/row-level **local feature importance** in black-box machine learning models.

This package implements the algorithm described in 
[Å trumbelj and Kononenko's (2014) sampling-based Shapley approximation algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10115-013-0679-x) 
to compute the stochastic Shapley values for a given model feature and the algorithm described in 
[Frye, Feige, & Rowat's (2019) Asymmetric Shapley values: incorporating causal knowledge into model-agnostic explainability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06358.pdf) 
to incorporate prior knowledge into the Shapley value calculation. Asymmetric Shapley values can be tuned by the researcher to avoid splitting 
the Shapley feature effects uniformly across related/correlated features--as is done in the symmetric case--and focus on the unique effect of a target 
feature after having conditioned on other pre-specified "causal" feature effects.

* **Flexibility**: 
    + Shapley values can be estimated for <u>any machine learning model</u> using a simple user-defined 
    `predict()` wrapper function.
    + Shapley values can be estimated by incorporating prior knowledge about causaility in the feature space; this is especially 
    useful for interpreting time series models with a temporal dependence.

* **Speed**:
    + The code itself hasn't necessarily been optimized for speed. The speed advantage of `shapFlex` comes in the form of giving the user the ability 
 to <u>select 1 or more target features of interest</u> and avoid having to compute Shapley values for all model features. This is especially 
 useful in high-dimensional models as the computation of a Shapley value is exponential in the number of features.

## Overview

* A vignette detailing how the algorithms work as well as how various types of causal assumptions can be 
specified in `shapFlex` is forthcoming.

## Examples

Below is an example of how `shapFlex` can be used to compute Shapley values for a subset of model 
features from a Random Forest model based on 3 sets of assumptions about causality amongst the model features:

**1. Symmetric:** Default. No causal knowledge is incorporated into the Shapley calculations.

**2. Asymmetric with weights = .5:** Agnostic causality. Similar to the symmetric algorithm. The difference is 
that, in the asymmetric algorithm, the entire set of causal effects is conditioned on as a group; the 
symmetric algorithm would condition on random subsets of the causal features.

**3. Asymmetric with weights = 1:** Pure causality. The Shapley estimates for the causal targets are 
based on the actual/true/known feature values of the causal effects. Put another way, the estimates for 
the causal targets have been conditioned on the causal effects which decreases their magnitude. 
The Shapley estimates for the causal effects will then increase correspondingly to satisfy the Shapley property 
that the sum of the feature-level effects equals the model prediction.
